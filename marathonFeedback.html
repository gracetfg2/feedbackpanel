The image is nice and sharp. It has all of the necessary information required. The text looks a bit unprofessional, I would have preferred something a bit more serious looking. The runner looks as if they are floating. I get the idea, but it looks a bit fake. The lens flare is a cool looking effect to silhouette the runner. The pink on the runner's shoes really helps to draw the eye to what the runner is doing. I really like this bit of detail.

<span class='table-text'>The Picture shown a woman running in a highway type of road, which doesn't fit the location (Central Park) of this race. Also, the girl seems to be shrunk a little bit, the shape looks not right. I found the fonts used in this poster kind of not very professional. I would adjust the size of the main title (Run@NYC) to make it bigger and put it in the middle top rather than the left. The 'register....' line is way too small and again I would use a different font for it. I would use sharper colors other than black and white too. Overall, it's not a very good design.
</span>

<span class='table-text'>I would rate the overall concept of the design to be quite good. I like the picture with the sun behind the runner which acts somewhat motivational to me. One downside i see is the very small letter size for the registration link site and don't like how curved is the 'price win announcement' - maybe better to be again on the bottom right but normal like the other sentences. Other than that, I think it looks quite good and appealing.

<span class='table-text'>The design is good but would have be much better if there was more bright color used and the fonts used should be more bold and good looking. The information should be more given with better details. The graphics used should be more appealing. The girl looking dull because of sun shade, it might be avoided. There is lot of space which could be better utilized. For the half marathon, the group of people running is better to be shown than just a single girl running. The color should be lively and appealing to make the flyer looking good

<span class='table-text'> I really like the attention put to the 300$ prizes. It will get more people to read the flyer, very good design choice. However, I dislike the stock photo that is put on top off, the girl looks like shes hovering, it’s very distracting. Also, the sun glare is very distracting as well, it’s not a really good photo. The flyer looks somehow low effort, its just text on a stock image (not a very good one at that). But it does convey everything it needs to. But I think it’s a huge waste printing a stock photo with 4 lines of text on it.

I enjoy the image itself and the font variation and overall color scheme because it seems to be in motion and highlights very well what the topic is as well. I really like the font because they aren't your standard Sans Serif type fonts that you see pretty routinely. It helps it stand out a bit and I enjoy for that fact. They have a nice contrast as well that makes them easy to read even if they are a bit on the cursive side.</span>

<span class='table-text'>The flyer has important information about the half marathon but it lacks a visual appeal. I think a better color composition could be used to make it more eye catching. I also believe that important Information like the cause being supported through the marathon could be included to attract more participants. The various elements of the flyer like text, images etc. seem to lack sync and a better alignment of the various elements can make the flyer stand out by giving it a balanced look.</span>

<span class='table-text'>The background image should have been edited a bit. I don't see detailing in the image. One cannot get the whole information about the event looking at the poster. The font at the top 'RUN@NYC' looks good. But there are very less details about the event. The font 'Top 3 runners' should not be tilted. The font size for all three details is different and the is not looking good. Needs a lot of change. But it would end up being a good flyer.</span>

<span class='table-text'>The visual element of the design is captivating with regards to the background. The font used is also nice but seems like it was very quickly done and not much thought or effort put into it. Again, the background image is nice, but the words seem too plain and not as 'fun' or 'inviting"'. Perhaps some encouraging words can be used to 'invite' runners for the event. The sun and shadow is a very nice and captivating image, but at times seems the suns brightness is a bit bothersome. Overall it is a nice flyer and some minor changes can be added/made.</span>
